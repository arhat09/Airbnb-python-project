# New York Airbnb Listings EDA Project - 2024

## Project Overview

This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings in New York City to reveal significant trends and patterns in the rental market. Leveraging Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and deriving meaningful insights.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

- Examine room types, pricing structures, and availability across neighborhoods.
- Explore host activity and listing characteristics.
- Identify potential price outliers.
- Offer recommendations for both Airbnb guests and hosts based on the insights.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 20,765 records with 22 features, including:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each listing
- `name`: Listing title
- `host_name`: Name of the listing's host
- `neighborhood_group`: Borough where the listing is located
- `latitude` and `longitude`: Listing geolocation
- `price`: Nightly rental price
- `room_type`: Type of accommodation (e.g., entire home, private room)
- `reviews_per_month`: Average number of monthly reviews
- `availability_365`: Days available for booking throughout the year

## Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning

- **Handling Missing Data**: Filled in missing values in key columns, including `price`, `neighborhood`, and `beds`.
- **Data Type Adjustment**: Converted `last_review` to a datetime format for time-based analysis.
- **Outlier Management**: Capped prices above $1,000 to reduce skew in visualizations.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Room Type Analysis**:
  - Visualized room type distribution with bar plots, revealing that entire homes/apartments are the most common.
- **Neighborhood Insights**:
  - Compared prices across different boroughs, finding Manhattan to have the highest average prices.
- **Availability Trends**:
  - Examined correlations between price, `availability_365`, number of reviews, and beds using heatmaps.
- **Price Distribution**:
  - Created histograms to display price distribution, with most listings falling between $50 and $300.
- **Host Listings**:
  - Used boxplots to analyze hosts with multiple listings, identifying top contributors.
- **Review Patterns**:
  - Explored relationships between number of reviews, price, and availability with pair plots.

### 3. Data Visualization

- **Pairplot**: Shows correlations among key features like price, availability, and review count.
- **Heatmap**: Highlights correlations among numerical variables.
- **Histograms and Boxplots**: Used to detect price outliers.
- **Bar Charts**: Illustrates distribution of room types and neighborhood groups.

## Key Findings and Insights

- **Pricing Trends**:
  - Manhattan listings are the most expensive, followed by Brooklyn.
  - Entire homes/apartments typically cost more than private or shared rooms.
- **Room Type Preferences**:
  - Entire homes/apartments dominate the listings, while private rooms are more budget-friendly.
- **Price Outliers**:
  - Listings priced above $10,000 were flagged, suggesting a need to filter such outliers.
- **Availability Patterns**:
  - Listings with high availability tend to have lower prices and higher review counts, likely due to positive guest experiences.
- **Host Activity**:
  - Some hosts manage multiple listings, indicating a shift toward professional hosting.


## Recommendations

- **For Guests**:
  - Look for listings with high availability and good reviews to improve your experience.
  - Consider private rooms in Brooklyn for affordable stays compared to Manhattan.
  
- **For Hosts**:
  - Increase availability and responsiveness to reviews to attract more bookings.
  - Set competitive pricing to align with neighborhood market trends.

## Future Directions

- **Predictive Modeling**: Use machine learning to predict rental prices based on factors like room type and location.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze guest reviews to gain insights into guest satisfaction and experience.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop a dynamic dashboard with Plotly or Tableau for real-time data exploration.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into New York's Airbnb market, supporting informed decision-making for both guests and hosts. By leveraging EDA techniques, weâ€™ve highlighted key trends and crafted actionable recommendations. Future enhancements may include predictive analytics and advanced data visualization to deepen our understanding of the market dynamics.
